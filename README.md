# MERNDemo
MERN Pattern scalable planner application

https://alexbmernapp.herokuapp.com

This is a full stack MERN application created following a demo. This isn't really my code, however I used this to gain a strong understanding of the MERN pattern,
MongoDB, and Redux. Not only that, this application was deployed to Heroku.

I followed the code examples and changed things minutely as I needed to and in the process I learned many things thanks to this excellent project.
